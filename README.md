## Build From Source

The *EMQ X* broker requires Erlang/OTP R21+ to build since 3.0 release.

For 4.3 and later versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emqx/emqx.git
cd emqx
make
_build/emqx/rel/emqx/bin console
```

For earlier versions, release has to be built from another repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emqx/emqx-rel.git
cd emqx-rel
make
_build/emqx/rel/emqx/bin/emqx console
```

## Quick Start

If emqx is built from source, `cd _buid/emqx/rel/emqx`.
Or change to the installation root directory if emqx is installed from a release package.

```bash
# Start emqx
./bin/emqx start

# Check Status
./bin/emqx_ctl status

# Stop emqx
./bin/emqx stop
```

To view the dashboard after running, use your browser to open: http://localhost:18083

## Test

### To test everything in one go

```
make eunit ct
```

### To run subset of the common tests

examples

```bash
./rebar3 ct --name 'test@127.0.0.1' -c -v --dir test,apps/emqx_sn,apps/emqx_coap
./rebar3 ct --name 'test@127.0.0.1' -c -v --dir apps/emqx_auth_mnesi --suite emqx_acl_mnesia_SUITE
./rebar3 ct --name 'test@127.0.0.1' -c -v --dir apps/emqx_auth_mnesi --suite emqx_acl_mnesia_SUITE --case t_rest_api
```

NOTE: Do *NOT* use full (relative) path to SUITE files like this `--suite apps/emqx_auth_mnesia/test/emqx_acl_mnesia_SUITE.erl`,
because it will lead to a full copy of `apps` dir into `_buid/test/lib/emqx`.

### Dialyzer
##### To Analyze all the apps
```
make dialyzer
```

##### To Analyse specific apps, (list of comma separated apps)
```
DIALYZER_ANALYSE_APP=emqx_lwm2m,emqx_auth_jwt,emqx_auth_ldap make dialyzer
```
